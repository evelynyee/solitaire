Command-line Klondike Solitaire app


This is a personal project I started in Fall 2021, just for fun. I haven't updated it since then, except to add the code to github in November 2023. I'm not currently developing this, and I don't have any solid plan for if/when I will come back to it.

To play the game, run the `solitaire.py` file in a command-line.

Right now, the game should have full basic functionality, but it's not very pretty.
Here are some updates I would like to implement:
1. Clean up code style (e.g. improve comments, reorganize classes/functions/files, flatten deep if-statements)
2. Switch to `asciimatics` or `curses` or some other text UI module for handling the display - currently I'm just using the basic print and input commands, and it's a little sloppy/visually unfriendly
    - Add color
    - Live interaction capture (e.g. to allow use of arrow keys)

To my knowledge, all of this code is original, but the concepts are definitely not. I do not intend to monetize this project.
